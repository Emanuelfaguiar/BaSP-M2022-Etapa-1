# WEEK 07 - JavaScript Storage

In this week i included more functions to the login and sign-up files.
When we click the buttons "continue", the all validated form data is sent to a server, then returns a message of succes, or a message of error (in case of 1 or more inputs are invalid).

In the login page, the message of succes appears ONLY when entering an existing user (in this case: rose@radiumtocket.com / password: BaSP2022).

In the sign up page, the success' message will appear only when all the inputs are correctly filled, if any error were found, the server will send a error message showing what needs to be fixed.
